# Web Scraping Hub

Welcome to the Web Scraping Hub! This repository houses the codebase for our advanced web scraping system that targets five distinct websites. Utilizing sophisticated scraping techniques and a custom-built TensorFlow model to solve CAPTCHAs on two of these sites, our project not only scrapes data efficiently but does so while navigating complex web security measures.

Additionally, our system incorporates a robust buy-sell interface, structured to support multiple user roles including SuperAdmin, Admin, Buyer, and Seller, each with distinct privileges and capabilities. This README provides an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, user role definitions, and guidelines for contribution.

## Features

- **Multi-site Scraping**: Automated scraping from five different websites.
- **CAPTCHA Resolution**: Integration of a TensorFlow-based model to solve CAPTCHAs on two websites.
- **User Role Hierarchy**:
  - **SuperAdmin**: Highest level of access, with capabilities to manage all users including deletion.
  - **Admin**: Manages system data visibility and handles Buyer registrations.
  - **Buyer**: Can register Sellers and initiate transactions.
  - **Seller**: Manages inventory and transaction records with Buyers.
- **Transaction Management**: Tracks and records transactions including details like PAN and form data exchanged between Buyers and Sellers.

## Project Structure


Certainly! Below is a markdown-formatted README.md file that you can directly paste into your GitHub repository.
